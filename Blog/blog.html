            <p>my friends Finn and Jack are in a band, it's pretty chill. They inspire me a lot to just make things for fun because making things is cool, and not worry too much about what happens after. I have no clue if thats how they feel but that when it make me think about. I think sometimes people be making stuff to come off a certain way, not because they just want to make something. This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDcUN4jiSY4"> video</a> they made and I like. I like the song. I like my friends. Jacks videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J3D2JIROdg">here. </a></p>
